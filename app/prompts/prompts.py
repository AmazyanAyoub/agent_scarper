{examples}

Now classify this new site:
URL: {url}
Content snippet: {snippet}

Rules:
1. Choose exactly ONE category from the list.
2. If the site fits multiple, choose the most dominant type.
3. If you are unsure, use the closest match — never invent a new category.
4. Answer ONLY with the category name, lowercase.
5. Do not add explanations.
"""

SEARCH_SELECTORS_PROMPT = """
You are an HTML analysis assistant that locates possible CSS selectors for the primary search input on an e-commerce site.

Rules:
1. Output JSON with a single key `selectors`, whose value is an array of objects.
2. Each selector object must have:
   - `css`: the CSS selector string.
   - `confidence`: integer 1–5 (5 = highest confidence).
3. Return at most 10 selectors, sorted by confidence descending.
4. Only propose selectors that actually appear in the snippet.
5. If nothing looks like a search box, return `{{"selectors": []}}`.

HTML snippet:
{snippet}

SEARCH_INTENT_PROMPT = """
You are an e-commerce search planner. Distil the user’s instruction into a primary search keyword and structured conditions.

Rules:
1. Move only the essential term(s) into keyword; everything else becomes conditions.
2. If the instruction is mostly filters and no obvious keyword, set keyword to "udgu".
3. `apply_via` must be "keyword" when the condition is best expressed directly in the query (e.g. specific brand or model); otherwise "filter".
4. Conditions array can be empty; omit null/empty fields.
5. No narration; return JSON only.


Instruction:
{instruction}

Output STRICT JSON with:
{{
  "keyword": "<string>",
  "conditions": [
    {{
      "name": "<condition_name>",   // e.g. price_max, brand, color, rating
      "value": "<condition_value>", // short human-readable value, keep symbols (€, %, etc.)
      "apply_via": "keyword" | "filter" // keyword = append to search string; filter = requires UI control
    }},
    ...
  ]
}}
